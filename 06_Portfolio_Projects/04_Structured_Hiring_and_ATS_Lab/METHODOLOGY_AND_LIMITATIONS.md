# Methodology and Limitations

## Build method

The enterprise project was generated from a fixed mathematical contract rather than an employer dataset. APD, all names, IDs, requisitions, dates, scores, events, decisions, and notes are fictional.

### 1. Define five requisition families

Five job specifications spanning G1–G4 were translated into required competencies, knockout rules, standardized assessments, BARS anchors, stage gates, capacity limits, privacy partitions, and audit evidence. Applicant blocks are fixed at 800, 1,600, 600, 400, and 600 records.

### 2. Generate the 4,000-candidate cohort

Candidate IDs run sequentially from `CAND-2026-0001` to `CAND-2026-4000`. Within every five sequential records, three are assigned to the Reference Group and two to the Focal Group. Because every requisition block is divisible by five, each family preserves the overall 60/40 partition: 2,400 Reference and 1,600 Focal candidates.

Names use the explicit pattern `Synthetic Candidate NNNN` to avoid invented contact information or accidental claims about real individuals. Applied dates, source channels, and screening values are deterministic functions of the sequence number and requisition start date, making the dataset reproducible.

### 3. Allocate stage progression

The knockout progression quotas are specified by requisition and cohort:

| Requisition | Reference progressed | Focal progressed | Total shortlisted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ENG-G4 | 125 | 72 | 197 |
| ENG-G1 | 250 | 145 | 395 |
| QUA-G3 | 94 | 54 | 148 |
| PNC-G2 | 62 | 36 | 98 |
| SCM-G2 | 93 | 55 | 148 |
| **Total** | **624** | **362** | **986** |

Presence of `Phone_Screen_Score` encodes knockout progression. Of the 986 shortlisted candidates, 500 receive all three governed assessment scores: 300 Reference and 200 Focal. The remaining 486 stop at Shortlisted. Non-progressors stop at Application Review.

### 4. Calculate composite evidence and hires

All 500 assessed finalists receive deterministic work-sample, four-component BARS, and job-knowledge scores. Candidate-level structured score is the mean of the four BARS components.

```text
Composite = 0.40 × Work Sample
          + 0.40 × Structured Interview
          + 0.20 × Job Knowledge

Bias Gap = Subjective Impression − Composite
```

Exactly 120 scored candidates are marked Hired according to preallocated requisition and cohort quotas: 10, 60, 15, 10, and 25. Candidate CAND-2026-0013 is explicitly set to work sample 4.00, structured interview 3.80, knowledge 4.00, composite 3.92, subjective impression 4.60, and gap +0.68; the candidate is not hired.

### 5. Generate 2,000 evaluation events

Every one of 500 scored candidates has four events: Work Sample Review, Structured Interview A, Structured Interview B, and Calibration Review. Interview IDs run from `INT-2026-0001` through `INT-2026-2000`.

A deterministic permutation rule distributes 164 late records through the sequence: an evaluation is late when `(event sequence × 37) mod 2,000 < 164`. Late turnaround is 49–72 hours; all other events are 12–48 hours. This produces exactly 1,836 on-time events and 164 late events, or 91.8% adherence.

### 6. Reconcile and publish

The acceptance suite verifies row counts, sequential IDs, schemas, foreign keys, per-requisition applications and hires, scoring arithmetic, cohort progression, SLA classification, privacy patterns, embedded JSON parity, pagination controls, and documentation traceability. Both dashboard files embed every CSV value as a JSON string.

## Statistical assumptions

- Scores are on a common 1.00–5.00 scale and higher values represent stronger constructed evidence.
- Empty downstream fields mean the stage was not reached; they are not zero.
- Cohort allocation and progression are engineered to the contract, not sampled from a population.
- Chi-square results describe the constructed 2×2 table and do not estimate a real employer effect.
- Requisition-level time to fill is an authoritative reporting value, including the fractional 30.5-day record.
- Feedback hours are authoritative even though date-only fields cannot reconstruct time-of-day.
- Offer and acceptance totals equal hires in this simulation.

## Limitations

### Synthetic evidence

No distribution, relationship, significance test, operational result, or utility estimate generalizes to a real employer. The deterministic generator is designed to make controls and reconciliation inspectable, not to mimic every feature of applicant behavior.

### No local criterion validation

The validity coefficients are literature-informed inputs, not APD estimates. There are no real performance criteria, reliability estimates, outcome follow-ups, confidence intervals for predictor validity, or cross-validation samples. Composite validity cannot be inferred by averaging component validities.

### Scale does not cure bias

A 4,000-row dataset increases statistical power but cannot repair a non-job-related rule, inaccessible assessment, misclassified group, biased criterion, or hidden job-family composition. Statistical significance and the four-fifths ratio answer different questions and require practical interpretation.

### Engineered parity after assessment

The assessed and hired stages intentionally have proportional cohort allocation. This makes reconciliation clear but is not evidence that a real process would produce parity. Production monitoring must examine applicant availability, qualifications, withdrawals, rule versions, accommodations, and job-level outcomes.

### Automation risk

High-volume knockout logic can multiply an error quickly. Production controls require human review for ambiguity, candidate appeal, idempotent transitions, load testing, kill switch, rollback, replay safety, and post-batch reconciliation.

### Construct and accessibility risk

Structured assessments can still measure irrelevant language fluency, test familiarity, device access, or time pressure. Real deployment needs accessible delivery, accommodations, candidate-reaction evidence, and proof that alternative modes preserve the job-related construct.

### Legal scope

DPDP, GDPR, and EEOC sources are governance benchmarks. Applicability varies by jurisdiction and processing context. This project is not legal advice, and the 180-day rejected-resume rule is a design choice requiring local review.

### Browser delivery

The source data and application logic are embedded. Tailwind CSS and Chart.js use CDNs; custom CSS and the semantic pipeline remain available if those libraries are not. Very large inline JSON increases file size and parse cost, so a production system would use authenticated server-side pagination and field projection.

## Ethical boundaries

Do not use the synthetic thresholds, scores, cohort labels, or candidate sequence for real employment decisions. Do not infer protected characteristics. Do not train an automated selection model on this constructed dataset. Candidates require notice, accommodation, human review, correction routes, and proportionate retention.

## Change control

Any source-data change must propagate to both embedded JSON payloads and reconciled documentation. Changes to a rule, threshold, weight, assessment, permission, or retention schedule require a version, rationale, approver, fairness review, UAT evidence, and release record.
